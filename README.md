# Mo_Roads
This Python file computes the minimal spanning tree of all missouri cities using Prim's algorithm.

The python library I used is matplotlib. If matplotlib's library does not show the graph at the end, try running the python file in 32 bit mode.

Towards to top of Mo_Cities_Prims.py there is a boolean variable called "DEBUG1". 
DEBUG1 controls whether or not the original full graph is rendered. It takes a while to actually render the original graph so it may be a good idea to set DEBUG1 = False in order to view just the MST instead of both.
